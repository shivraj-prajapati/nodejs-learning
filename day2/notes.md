# Day 2: Modules and NPM
- Created a custom module (calculator.js) with basic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Imported the custom module in the main file (app.js) using require('./calculator').
- Used the calculator functions to perform operations and log the results to the console.
