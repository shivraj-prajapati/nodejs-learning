# Day 26: Expanding the Express.js Server
- Learned how to create additional endpoints in the Express server.
- Set up a server that handles three new GET requests:
  - **User Endpoint**: Responds with a JSON object containing user details at the `/user` endpoint.
    - User details include `id`, `name`, and `email`.
  - **Products Endpoint**: Responds with an array of product objects at the `/products` endpoint.
    - Each product includes `id`, `name`, and `price`.
  - **Message Endpoint**: Responds with a custom JSON message at the `/message` endpoint.
    - The response contains a `status` and a `message`.
- Server continues to listen on port **3000**.
- Important concepts:
  - `res.json()`: Used to send a JSON response back to the client.
