# **Day 20: Express.js** : Simple POST Requests and File Handling

### 1. `app.post('/submit')`
**Function**: Defines a simple POST request at the `/submit` endpoint. It collects data from the request body in chunks and sends it back as a response. This is useful for debugging or for scenarios where you want to see the raw data sent in a POST request.

### 2. `app.post('/submit-file')`
**Function**: Handles POST requests at the `/submit-file` endpoint. It listens for incoming data chunks, concatenates them into a complete string, and then writes this string to a file named `data.txt`. If writing to the file is successful, it sends a success message; otherwise, it responds with an error status code (500) and an error message.

### 3. `fs.writeFile()`
**Function**: A method from the Node.js `fs` module that is used to write data to a file asynchronously. It takes three arguments: the name of the file to write to, the data to be written, and a callback function to handle any errors that may occur during the write operation.

### 4. `app.listen(port, ...)`
**Function**: Starts the Express server on the specified port (3000 in this case) and logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running. This is the entry point for the server to begin listening for incoming requests.

### Example of Sending Data via POST
To test the POST endpoints, you can use tools like Postman or cURL. Hereâ€™s how you might structure the data in Postman:
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/submit`
- **Method**: POST
- **Body**: Raw data (for example, `name=Rocky&age=21`)

### Example of Data Written to `data.txt`
When you send the POST request to `/submit-file` with the body `name=Rocky&age=21`, the `data.txt` file will contain the following:
