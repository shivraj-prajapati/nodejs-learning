# Day 25: Basics of Express.js Server
- Learned how to import and use the **Express** framework.
- Set up a simple server that responds to different types of requests:
  - **String Response**: Responds with plain text at the `/string` endpoint.
  - **JSON Response**: Responds with a JSON object at the `/json` endpoint, including a message and data array.
  - **HTML Response**: Responds with an HTML formatted message at the `/html` endpoint.
- Server listens on port **3000**.
- Important methods and concepts:
  - `app.use()`: Middleware for parsing JSON request bodies.
  - `app.get()`: Defines routes for handling GET requests.
  - `res.send()`: Sends responses back to the client.
  - `app.listen()`: Starts the server and listens for incoming connections.
