# Day 27: Express.js Basics - Serving HTML File
- Set up an Express.js server using the `express` module.
- Imported the `path` module to handle file paths.
- Created a route for the root (`'/'`) to send an HTML file using `res.sendFile()`.
- Handled errors during file transmission using an error callback in `sendFile()`.
- Server listens on port 3000.
- Important methods and concepts:
  - `express()`: To create an Express app.
  - `app.get()`: To define a route handler for HTTP GET requests.
  - `res.sendFile()`: To serve files from the server.
  - `app.listen()`: To start the server and listen on a specific port.
