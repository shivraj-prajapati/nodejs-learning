# nodejs-learning
This repository contains my personal Node.js learning journey. It includes practice code, examples, and notes as I progress from basic concepts to more advanced topics. Follow along to see how I'm learning Node.js step by step, and feel free to explore or contribute to my practice exercises.

# Node.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Node.js Learning** repository! This is where I'm documenting my progress as I learn and practice Node.js, starting from the basics and gradually moving toward more advanced concepts. Each folder represents a different learning session with code examples and notes.

## What You'll Find
- **Day-wise Practice Code**: Each day/session has its own folder with code examples.
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: From simple Node.js server setup to using frameworks like Express.js.
- **Notes and Concepts**: Key learnings and important concepts are noted in each session.

## Folder Structure
- `day1/` - Basic Node.js server using the HTTP module.
- `day2/` - Understanding modules and using NPM.
- `day3/` - Introduction to Express.js framework.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivraj-prajapati/nodejs-learning.git
   ```

   ## Getting Started

2. To run the Node.js application for any day, navigate to the respective day's folder and execute the following command:

```bash
cd day1
node app.js
```

   ## Why This Repo?
This repository is for documenting my learning process, keeping a record of my Node.js journey, and potentially helping others who are learning Node.js as well.
