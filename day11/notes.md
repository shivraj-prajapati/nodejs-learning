# Day 11 :  File Creation Methods in Node.js
- Used `fs.writeFile()` to create a new file or overwrite an existing file with specified content.
- Utilized `fs.appendFile()` to add new content to an existing file, creating the file if it does not exist.
- Implemented `fs.open()` to manually open a file with specific flags for more control over file operations.
- Employed the promises-based API `fs.promises` for asynchronous file operations, enhancing readability and error handling.
- Applied `fs.writeFileSync()` for synchronous file creation or overwriting, blocking execution until the operation completes.
