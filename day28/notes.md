# Day 28: Express.js - Route Handling and Redirection
- Set up an Express.js server using the `express` module.
- Created two routes:
  - `/home`: Responds with a message "Welcome to the Home Page".
  - `/about`: Redirects to the `/home` route using `res.redirect()`.
- The server listens on port 3000.
- Important methods and concepts:
  - `app.get()`: To define route handlers for HTTP GET requests.
  - `res.send()`: To send a plain text response to the client.
  - `res.redirect()`: To redirect the client to another route.
  - `app.listen()`: To start the server and listen on a specific port.
